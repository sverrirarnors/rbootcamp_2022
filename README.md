## Hi and welcome to the R Bootcamp 2022 (MACIS & ISTP)!

This repository contains the slides, exercises, and the corresponding solutions of the R Bootcamp 2021. The boot camp is structured as a 1.5-day course for incoming students of the Master in Comparative and International Studies (see [MACIS](https://macis.gess.ethz.ch)) and the Master in Science, Technology, and Policy (see [MSc ETH STP](https://istp.ethz.ch/education/master.html)), respectively. In the spirit of reproducibility and the open-source movement, we make this repository publicly available to all those who want to acquire basic knowledge of R themselves or teach it to others as instructors.
