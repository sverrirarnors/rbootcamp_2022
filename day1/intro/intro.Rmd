- Meet the instructors

- Day 1: The basics of R (Studio)

- Day 2: Data wrangling and visualizations

- Social event with GessWho!

---


## First things first

- The lessons are fairly packed but don't worry: Everything is available [online](https://github.com/sverrirarnors/rbootcamp_2022)

- Feel free to ask questions at any time

- We have very different levels when it comes to coding. Please keep this in mind and help first rather than getting impatient

**The guiding teaching principle of this course:**

> Tell me and I forget <br> teach me and I remember, <br> involve me and I learn.

- Shoutout to Charles Lanfear (@clanfear) for providing the slides

- Don't hesitate to share the slides and exercises as well

## Any experience with R?

---

## Any experience with other languages?

  theme(axis.title = element_blank(),
        panel.grid = element_blank(),

```

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=10}
plot_languages
```

---

## Equal parts STP/MACIS students

```{r, echo=FALSE, fig.width=10}
# library
library(treemapify)
 
# Create data
group <- c("STP","MACIS")
value <- c(9, 10)
data <- data.frame(group,value)
 
# treemap
ggplot(data, 
aes(area = value, fill = group,label = group)) +
   geom_treemap() +
   geom_treemap_text(
     colour = "white",
     place = "centre",
     size = 30) +
  theme_xaringan() +
  labs(fill = "") +
  scale_fill_brewer(type= "qual", palette = "Accent") +
  theme(legend.position = "none")

# R or Python?

- The primary objective of R is/was data analysis and statistics. The primary objective of Python is/was deployment and production. 

**BUT:**

- What language do your colleagues use?

- Who is working with the data?

- What tasks are you performing?

---

# R or Python?

--
- R is better at
  - Creating graphics and visualizations
  - Working with statistical models and tests
  - Presenting data
--
- Python is better at
  - Non-statistical tasks such as web scraping, deep learning
--
- R can run Python code (using [reticulate](https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/))
--
In your core courses you will be working with simple statistical models → R will be better!
--

.footnote[https://www.coursera.org/articles/python-or-r-for-data-analysis]

---
# Why R?

R is a programming language built for statistical computing.

If one already knows Stata or similar software, why use R?

--

* R is *free*, so you don't need a terminal server or license.

--

* R has a *very* large community for support and packages.

--

* R can handle virtually any data format.

--

* R makes replication *easy*.

--

* R is a *language* so it can do *everything*.<sup>1</sup>

.footnote[[1] Including generate these slides (using RMarkdown)!]

---

# R Studio

R Studio is a integrated development environment (IDE) for R that can make your life *easier*.

--

RStudio can:
--

* Organize your code, output, and plots.

--

* Auto-complete code and highlight syntax.

--

* Help view data and objects.

--

* [Enable easy integration of R code into documents.](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/)

--

If you are very stubborn, you can use other editors, but I have always come back to R Studio

---
# Getting Started

Open up RStudio now and choose *File > New File > R Script*.

Then, let's get oriented with the interface:

* *Top Left*: Code **editor** pane, data viewer (browse with tabs)

* *Bottom Left*: **Console** for running code (`>` prompt)

* *Top Right*: List of objects in **environment**, code **history** tab.

* *Bottom Right*: Tabs for browsing files, viewing plots, managing packages, and viewing help files.

You can change the layout in *Preferences > Pane Layout*. Also, there are a lot of very useful shortcuts!

---

# Editing and Running Code

There are several ways to run R code in RStudio:
--

* Highlight lines in the **editor** window and click *Run* at the top or hit `Ctrl+Enter` or `⌘+Enter` to run them all.

--

* With your **caret** on a line you want to run, hit `Ctrl+Enter` or `⌘+Enter`. Note your caret moves to the next line, so you can run code sequentially with repeated presses. 

--

* Type individual lines in the **console** and press `Enter`.

--

The console will show the lines you ran followed by any printed output.

---

# Incomplete Code

If you mess up (e.g. leave off a parenthesis), R might show a `+` sign prompting you to finish the command:

```{r Coding 1, eval=FALSE}
> (11-2
+
```

Finish the command or hit `Esc` to get out of this.

---

# R as a Calculator

In the **console**, type `123 + 456 + 789` and hit `Enter`.
--

```{r Calc 1}
123 + 456 + 789
```

--

The `[1]` in the output indicates the numeric **index** of the first element on that line.

--

Now in your blank R document in the **editor**, try typing the line `sqrt(400)` and either
clicking *Run* or hitting `Ctrl+Enter` or `⌘+Enter`.

--

```{r Calc 2}
sqrt(400)
```

---

# Functions and Help

`sqrt()` is an example of a **function** in R.

If we didn't have a good guess as to what `sqrt()` will do, we can type `?sqrt` in the console
and look at the **Help** panel on the right.

```{r Help, eval=FALSE}
?sqrt
```

**Arguments** are the *inputs* to a function. In this case, the only argument to `sqrt()`
is `x` which can be a number or a vector of numbers.

Help files provide documentation on how to use functions and what functions produce.

---

# R Projects

Usually, you have several scripts, numerous datasets and other files. Where are they stored?

```{r, eval=FALSE}
getwd()
```

You can specify the working directory at the beginning of each session...

```{r, eval=FALSE}
setwd()
```

... or use R Projects (a product by R Studio) instead. How does it work?

1. Creates a project file (with an .Rproj extension) within the project directory.
2. Creates a hidden directory (named .Rproj.user) where project-specific temporary files are stored. 
3. Loads the project into RStudio and display its name in the Projects toolbar 

This is super useful when collaborating on different operating systems!
